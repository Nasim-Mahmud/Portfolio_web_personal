                          example of the need for secure end-to-end
                          communication. This program aims to transmit important
                          or sensitive national security messages between
                          authorized personnel. One must be eligible to use this
                          program as an admin or a user. Three-step verification
                          is used in the design of this program to guard against
                          unauthorized access. The administrator and user can
                          access this program by entering their username and
                          password. After some verification, they can deliver
                          messages to one another. The program will securely
                          store every message and send it to its intended
                          recipient with the appropriate security.

                          area of various regions over time. Bangladesh's rural
                          areas have undergone numerous changes comparable to
                          this. There is considerably less water in the area,
                          and there are fewer green spaces. We used the Google
                          Earth engine to create a GIS environment model to
                          highlight the problem. NASA and the U.S. Geological

                          (USGS LANDSAT 8 Reflectance Tier 1). By gathering data
                          over the previous 10 years, we visualized the data
                          using a time-lapse video.

                          circumstances. In such cases, autonomous exploring
                          robots can be helpful because they can search the site
                          independently for survivors. AOAVER, which stands for
                          Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Exploring Robot, is the
                          name of the robot that we developed. AOAVER can
                          navigate static obstacles and explore locations that
                          are inaccessible to humans.

                          Still, Python is the one with which I feel the most

                          every system, is simple to understand, and doesn't
                          require much syntax. I have built some projects while
                          learning Python from online courses. Over time, this

                          university, I formed a team with some friends to
                          participate in the intra and inter-university robotics
                          competitions. We named our group "Ignite." With a
                          spark of passion and a hunger for knowledge, we
                          embarked on a journey of creativity and innovation.
                          Together, we designed and built robots that competed
                          in various challenges, from soccer to obstacle
                          courses. Our team, Ignite, quickly rose through the
                          ranks, winning several competitions and bringing honor
                          to ourselves and our university. I learned to work
                          with a remote-controlled mobile robot, which we turned
                          into a soccer-playing robot that won a championship.
                          Additionally, I participated in several robotics
                          workshops, including one on UAVs, where I won first
                          prize in the exam. Robotics competitions have taught
                          me valuable lessons about teamwork, problem-solving,
                          and perseverance. They have also helped me develop my
                          engineering and programming skills. I am grateful for
                          the opportunity to participate in these competitions

                          usually struggled to access basic healthcare that
                          comes with difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                          People face problems in healthcare due to several
                          factors, particularly in government hospital systems.
                          We conducted qualitative research during the pandemic
                          where the study is ongoing to understand these issues.
                          Initially, we have interviewed n=32 people with
                          different socioeconomic backgrounds to understand the
                          medical services they receive from Bangladesh's
                          healthcare systems and how COVID-19 has affected them.
                          Our research shows that participants face difficulties
                          finding appropriate doctors for the treatment and lack
                          information regarding the prescribed medicine prices.
                          However, the participants suggested a few possible
                          online interventions that might help them in their
                          points of view. Based on findings, we came up with
                          recommendations regarding possible online-based
                          healthcare platforms that can help anyone availing
                          healthcare in the easiest ways in the future.

                          <span>Abstract: </span>An improved version of Alpha-N,
                          a self-powered, wheel-driven Automated Delivery Robot
                          (ADR), is presented in this study. Alpha-N-V2 is
                          capable of navigating autonomously by detecting and
                          avoiding objects or obstacles in its path. For
                          autonomous navigation and path planning, Alpha-N uses
                          a vector map and calculates the shortest path by Grid
                          Count Method (GCM) of Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The RFID
                          Reading System (RRS) is assembled in Alpha-N to read
                          Landmark determination with Radio Frequency
                          Identification (RFID) tags. With the help of the RFID
                          tags, Alpha-N verifies the path for identification
                          between source and destination and calibrates the
                          current position. Along with the RRS, GCM, to detect
                          and avoid obstacles, an Object Detection Module (ODM)
                          is constructed by Faster R-CNN with VGGNet-16
                          architecture that builds and supports the Path
                          Planning System (PPS).

                          <span>Abstract: </span>Alpha-N - A self-powered,
                          wheel-driven Automated Delivery Robot (ADR) is
                          presented in this paper. The ADR is capable of
                          navigating autonomously by detecting and avoiding
                          objects or obstacles in its path. It uses a vector map
                          of the path and calculates the shortest path by Grid
                          Count Method (GCM) of Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Landmark
                          determination with Radio Frequency Identification
                          (RFID) tags are placed in the path for identification
                          and verification of source and destination, and also
                          for the re-calibration of the current position. On the
                          other hand, an Object Detection Module (ODM) is built
                          by Faster R-CNN with VGGNet-16 architecture for
                          supporting path planning by detecting and recognizing
                          obstacles. The Path Planning System (PPS) is combined
                          with the output of the GCM, the RFID Reading System
                          (RRS) and also by the binary results of ODM. This PPS
                          requires a minimum speed of 200 RPM and 75 s duration
                          for the robot to successfully relocate its position by
                          reading an RFID tag. In the result analysis phase, the
                          ODM exhibits an accuracy of 83.75%, RRS shows 92.3%
                          accuracy and the PPS maintains an accuracy of 85.3%.
                          Stacking all these 3 modules, the ADR is built, tested
                          and validated which shows significant improvement in
                          terms of performance and usability comparing with
                          other service robots.
